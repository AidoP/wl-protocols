description = '''
An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which allows the
client to specify the cropping and scaling of the surface
contents.

This interface works with two concepts: the source rectangle (src_x,
src_y, src_width, src_height), and the destination size (dst_width,
dst_height). The contents of the source rectangle are scaled to the
destination size, and content outside the source rectangle is ignored.
This state is double-buffered, and is applied on the next
wl_surface.commit.

The two parts of crop and scale state are independent: the source
rectangle, and the destination size. Initially both are unset, that
is, no scaling is applied. The whole of the current wl_buffer is
used as the source, and the surface size is as defined in
wl_surface.attach.

If the destination size is set, it causes the surface size to become
dst_width, dst_height. The source (rectangle) is scaled to exactly
this size. This overrides whatever the attached wl_buffer size is,
unless the wl_buffer is NULL. If the wl_buffer is NULL, the surface
has no content and therefore no size. Otherwise, the size is always
at least 1x1 in surface local coordinates.

If the source rectangle is set, it defines what area of the wl_buffer is
taken as the source. If the source rectangle is set and the destination
size is not set, then src_width and src_height must be integers, and the
surface size becomes the source rectangle size. This results in cropping
without scaling. If src_width or src_height are not integers and
destination size is not set, the bad_size protocol error is raised when
the surface state is applied.

The coordinate transformations from buffer pixel coordinates up to
the surface-local coordinates happen in the following order:
1. buffer_transform (wl_surface.set_buffer_transform)
2. buffer_scale (wl_surface.set_buffer_scale)
3. crop and scale (wp_viewport.set*)
This means, that the source rectangle coordinates of crop and scale
are given in the coordinates after the buffer transform and scale,
i.e. in the coordinates that would be the surface-local coordinates
if the crop and scale was not applied.

If src_x or src_y are negative, the bad_value protocol error is raised.
Otherwise, if the source rectangle is partially or completely outside of
the non-NULL wl_buffer, then the out_of_buffer protocol error is raised
when the surface state is applied. A NULL wl_buffer does not raise the
out_of_buffer error.

The x, y arguments of wl_surface.attach are applied as normal to
the surface. They indicate how many pixels to remove from the
surface size from the left and the top. In other words, they are
still in the surface-local coordinate system, just like dst_width
and dst_height are.

If the wl_surface associated with the wp_viewport is destroyed,
all wp_viewport requests except 'destroy' raise the protocol error
no_surface.

If the wp_viewport object is destroyed, the crop and scale
state is removed from the wl_surface. The change will be applied
on the next wl_surface.commit.'''
