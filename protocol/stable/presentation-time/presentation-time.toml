description = '''
This event tells the client in which clock domain the
compositor interprets the timestamps used by the presentation
extension. This clock is called the presentation clock.

The compositor sends this event when the client binds to the
presentation interface. The presentation clock does not change
during the lifetime of the client connection.

The clock identifier is platform dependent. On Linux/glibc,
the identifier value is one of the clockid_t values accepted
by clock_gettime(). clock_gettime() is defined by
POSIX.1-2001.

Timestamps in this clock domain are expressed as tv_sec_hi,
tv_sec_lo, tv_nsec triples, each component being an unsigned
32-bit value. Whole seconds are in tv_sec which is a 64-bit
value combined from tv_sec_hi and tv_sec_lo, and the
additional fractional part in tv_nsec as nanoseconds. Hence,
for valid timestamps tv_nsec must be in [0, 999999999].

Note that clock_id applies only to the presentation clock,
and implies nothing about e.g. the timestamps used in the
Wayland core protocol input events.

Compositors should prefer a clock which does not jump and is
not slewed e.g. by NTP. The absolute value of the clock is
irrelevant. Precision of one millisecond or better is
recommended. Clients must be able to query the current clock
value directly, not by asking the compositor.'''

A presentation_feedback object returns an indication that a

summary = 'bitmask of flags in presented event'
description = '''
These flags provide information about how the presentation of
the related content update was done. The intent is to help
clients assess the reliability of the feedback and the visual
quality with respect to possible tearing and timings. The
flags are:

VSYNC:
The presentation was synchronized to the "vertical retrace" by
the display hardware such that tearing does not happen.
Relying on user space scheduling is not acceptable for this
flag. If presentation is done by a copy to the active
frontbuffer, then it must guarantee that tearing cannot
happen.

HW_CLOCK:
The display hardware provided measurements that the hardware
driver converted into a presentation timestamp. Sampling a
clock in user space is not acceptable for this flag.

HW_COMPLETION:
The display hardware signalled that it started using the new
image content. The opposite of this is e.g. a timer being used
to guess when the display hardware has switched to the new
image content.

ZERO_COPY:
The presentation of this update was done zero-copy. This means
the buffer from the client was given to display hardware as
is, without copying it. Compositing with OpenGL counts as
copying, even if textured directly from the client buffer.
Possible zero-copy cases include direct scanout of a
fullscreen surface and a surface on a hardware overlay.'''

summary = 'the content update was displayed'
description = '''
The associated content update was displayed to the user at the
indicated time (tv_sec_hi/lo, tv_nsec). For the interpretation of
the timestamp, see presentation.clock_id event.

The timestamp corresponds to the time when the content update
turned into light the first time on the surface's main output.
Compositors may approximate this from the framebuffer flip
completion events from the system, and the latency of the
physical display path if known.

This event is preceded by all related sync_output events
telling which output's refresh cycle the feedback corresponds
to, i.e. the main output for the surface. Compositors are
recommended to choose the output containing the largest part
of the wl_surface, or keeping the output they previously
chose. Having a stable presentation output association helps
clients predict future output refreshes (vblank).

The 'refresh' argument gives the compositor's prediction of how
many nanoseconds after tv_sec, tv_nsec the very next output
refresh may occur. This is to further aid clients in
predicting future refreshes, i.e., estimating the timestamps
targeting the next few vblanks. If such prediction cannot
usefully be done, the argument is zero.

If the output does not have a constant refresh rate, explicit
video mode switches excluded, then the refresh argument must
be zero.

The 64-bit value combined from seq_hi and seq_lo is the value
of the output's vertical retrace counter when the content
update was first scanned out to the display. This value must
be compatible with the definition of MSC in
GLX_OML_sync_control specification. Note, that if the display
path has a non-zero latency, the time instant specified by
this counter may differ from the timestamp's.

If the output does not have a concept of vertical retrace or a
refresh cycle, or the output device is self-refreshing without
a way to query the refresh count, then the arguments seq_hi
and seq_lo must be zero.'''
