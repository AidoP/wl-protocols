name = 'wp_primary_selection_unstable_v1'
summary = 'Primary selection protocol'
description = '''
This protocol provides the ability to have a primary selection device to
match that of the X server. This primary selection is a shortcut to the
common clipboard selection, where text just needs to be selected in order
to allow copying it elsewhere. The de facto way to perform this action
is the middle mouse button, although it is not limited to this one.

Clients wishing to honor primary selection should create a primary
selection source and set it as the selection through
wp_primary_selection_device.set_selection whenever the text selection
changes. In order to minimize calls in pointer-driven text selection,
it should happen only once after the operation finished. Similarly,
a NULL source should be set when text is unselected.

wp_primary_selection_offer objects are first announced through the
wp_primary_selection_device.data_offer event. Immediately after this event,
the primary data offer will emit wp_primary_selection_offer.offer events
to let know of the mime types being offered.

When the primary selection changes, the client with the keyboard focus
will receive wp_primary_selection_device.selection events. Only the client
with the keyboard focus will receive such events with a non-NULL
wp_primary_selection_offer. Across keyboard focus changes, previously
focused clients will receive wp_primary_selection_device.events with a
NULL wp_primary_selection_offer.

In order to request the primary selection data, the client must pass
a recent serial pertaining to the press event that is triggering the
operation, if the compositor deems the serial valid and recent, the
wp_primary_selection_source.send event will happen in the other end
to let the transfer begin. The client owning the primary selection
should write the requested data, and close the file descriptor
immediately.

If the primary selection owner client disappeared during the transfer,
the client reading the data will receive a
wp_primary_selection_device.selection event with a NULL
wp_primary_selection_offer, the client should take this as a hint
to finish the reads related to the no longer existing offer.

The primary selection owner should be checking for errors during
writes, merely cancelling the ongoing transfer if any happened.'''
