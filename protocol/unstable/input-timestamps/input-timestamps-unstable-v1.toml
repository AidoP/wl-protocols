description = '''
This protocol specifies a way for a client to request and receive
high-resolution timestamps for input events.

Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
interface version number is reset.'''

The timestamp event is associated with the first subsequent input event
carrying a timestamp which belongs to the set of input events this
object is subscribed to.

The timestamp provided by this event is a high-resolution version of
the timestamp argument of the associated input event. The provided
timestamp is in the same clock domain and is at least as accurate as
the associated input event timestamp.

The timestamp is expressed as tv_sec_hi, tv_sec_lo, tv_nsec triples,
each component being an unsigned 32-bit value. Whole seconds are in
tv_sec which is a 64-bit value combined from tv_sec_hi and tv_sec_lo,
and the additional fractional part in tv_nsec as nanoseconds. Hence,
for valid timestamps tv_nsec must be in [0, 999999999].'''
