summary = 'control behavior when display idles'
description = '''
This interface permits inhibiting the idle behavior such as screen
blanking, locking, and screensaving. The client binds the idle manager
globally, then creates idle-inhibitor objects for each surface.

Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
interface version number is reset.'''

description = '''
An idle inhibitor prevents the output that the associated surface is
visible on from being set to a state where it is not visually usable due
to lack of user interaction (e.g. blanked, dimmed, locked, set to power
save, etc.) Any screensaver processes are also blocked from displaying.

If the surface is destroyed, unmapped, becomes occluded, loses
visibility, or otherwise becomes not visually relevant for the user, the
idle inhibitor will not be honored by the compositor; if the surface
subsequently regains visibility the inhibitor takes effect once again.
Likewise, the inhibitor isn't honored if the system was already idled at
the time the inhibitor was established, although if the system later
de-idles and re-idles the inhibitor will take effect.'''
