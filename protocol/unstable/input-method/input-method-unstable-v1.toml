summary = 'input method context'
description = '''
Corresponds to a text input on the input method side. An input method context
is created on text input activation on the input method side. It allows
receiving information about the text input from the application via events.
Input method contexts do not keep state after deactivation and should be
destroyed after deactivation is handled.

Text is generally UTF-8 encoded, indices and lengths are in bytes.

Serials are used to synchronize the state between the text input and
an input method. New serials are sent by the text input in the
commit_state request and are used by the input method to indicate
the known text input state in events like preedit_string, commit_string,
and keysym. The text input can then ignore events from the input method
which are based on an outdated state (for example after a reset).

Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
interface version number is reset.'''
